# Tensorflow Deep Learning Solutions for Images
This is the code repository for [Tensorflow Deep Learning Solutions for Images](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/tensorflow-deep-learning-solutions-images-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788396899), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Tensorflow is Google’s popular offering for machine learning and deep learning. It has quickly become a popular choice of tool for performing fast, efficient, and accurate deep learning. This course presents the implementation of practical, real-world projects, teaching you how to leverage Tensforflow’s capabilties to perform efficient deep learning. 

In this video, you will be acquainted with the different paradigms of performing deep learning such as deep neural nets, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and more, and how they can be implemented using Tensorflow. 

This will be demonstrated with the help of end-to-end implementations of three real-world projects on popular topic areas such as natural language processing, image classification, fraud detection, and more. By the end of this course, you will have mastered all the concepts of deep learning and their implementation with Tensorflow and Keras.
